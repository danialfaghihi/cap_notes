The stress-strain behavior comprised elastic, yield, strain softening and strain hardening regions that were qualitatively in agreement with previous simulations and experimental results. The chain lengths, number of chains, strain rate and temperature dependence of the stress-strain behavior was investigated. The energy contributions from the united atom potential were calculated as a function of strain to help elucidate the inherent deformation mechanisms within the elastic, yield, and strain hardening regions. The results of examining the partitioning of energy show that the elastic and yield regions were mainly dominated by interchain non-bonded interactions whereas strain hardening regions were mainly dominated by intra-chain dihedral motion of polyethylene. Additional results show how internal mechanisms associated with bond length, bond angle, dihedral distributions, change of free volume and chain entanglements evolve with increasing deformation. "

Computational efforts are reduced by parametrizing the current profile linearly in terms of a number of physical parameters. Results of detailed comparative calculations and a sensitivity study are described. Illustrative calculations to reconstruct the current profiles and plasma shapes in ohmically and auxiliarily heated Doublet III plasmas are given which show many interesting features of the current profiles.}

  abstract={A novel method for inferring the toroidal current distribution from measurements of magnetic field and flux is presented. The method uses a Bayesian approach that gives the full joint probability distribution over all possible current distributions consistent with the measurements and their uncertainties. The plasma current is modelled as a grid of toroidal current-carrying solid beams with rectangular cross sections and the tomographic inversion corresponds to extracting information, such as mean values, standard deviations and marginal distributions from the joint posterior distribution over beam currents, as well as functions of the currents: plasma boundary, internal flux surfaces, X-points, etc. The method's intended primary usage is as a foundation for a principled probabilistic integration of multiple diagnostics, an example of which will be demonstrated. However, with suitable informative prior distributions, the method can be used on its own, giving in addition to best estimates, 'error bars' on plasma boundary, internal flux surfaces, X-point, etc. A fast approximation, suitable for realtime reconstruction of boundary, flux surfaces and q -profiles, will also be presented.}

  abstract={Plasma turbulence characteristics, including radial correlation lengths, decorrelation times, amplitude profile and flow velocity, have been measured during a ρ* scan on DIII-D while all other transport relevant dimensionless quantities (e.g., β, ν*, κ, q, T e /T i ) are held nearly constant. The turbulence is measured by examining the correlation properties of the local long wavelength (k ⊥ ρ i ≤ 1) density fluctuations, measured with beam emission spectroscopy. The radial correlation length of the turbulence L c,r is shown to scale with the local ion gyroradius, L c,r ≈ 5ρ i , while the decorrelation times scale with the local acoustic velocity as τ c ~a/c s . The turbulent diffusivity parameter, D~(L c ,r 2 /τ c ), scales in a roughly gyro-Bohm-like fashion, as predicted by the gyrokinetic equations governing turbulent transport. The experimental one fluid power balance heat diffusivity scaling and that from GLF23 modelling compare reasonably well.}

  abstract={Scaling laws for plasma energy confinement must be invariant under any transformation which leaves the basic plasma equations themselves invariant. Hence, constraints can be placed on the scaling laws even though the calculation of energy loss may be quite intractable. These constraints are derived for several plasma models and shown to be characteristic of the model. Hence, in addition to reducing the number of parameters which have to be obtained empirically, these results could delineate which plasma models are appropriate for the calculation of losses. They show that the empirical scaling laws at present proposed for tokamaks are incompatible with many conventional plasma models.}

  journal={Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
  volume={46},
  number={5A},
  pages={A195},
  year={2004},
  abstract={This paper reports the first results of collaborative experiments in JT-60U and JET to compare ELMy H-mode characteristics in the two machines. The JT-60U/JET identity experiments were aimed explicitly at matching edge pedestal parameters in plasmas of the same geometry. The similar size of the two devices allows plasma configurations and conditions to be established for which the match of the dimensionless parameters (ρ * , ν * , β and q 95 ) and of the equilibrium geometry is carried out in plasmas that are also almost identical in dimensional terms. The results of the power and density scans at fixed (and matched) I p − B T show that, in a common range of ρ * , the pedestal electron collisionality, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/46/5A/021/ppcf170226in001.gif] {\nu_{\rme}^{\ast }} , and normalized pressure, β p,ped do not match in the two machines, against expectations. In particular, the range of β p,ped of JT-60U ELMy H-modes with Type I ELMs is accessible to JET plasmas only with a Type III ELM edge, and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/46/5A/021/ppcf170226in001.gif] {\nu_{\rme}^{\ast }} in JT-60U is consistently higher by ≈2 than in JET, for the same ρ * . A comparison of n e and T e pedestal profiles indicates that ∇ T e is comparable in the two devices, while JET n e profiles are steeper than JT-60U. The global energy confinement enhancement factor ( H 98 y − 2) is higher in JET than in JT-60U, and part of this difference is attributed to the reduced pedestal pressure in JT-60U compared with JET. The two experiments are analysed in detail to try to identify 'hidden' physics that may be the cause of the failure to achieve the pedestal identity as predicted. Although a full explanation for the different behaviour of the edge pedestal in the two devices has not yet been found, the possible influence of aspect ratio effects on MHD stability, differences in the plasma current profile and ripple loss (and rotation) effects are discussed.}
